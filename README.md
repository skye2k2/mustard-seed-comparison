# Mustard Seed Size Comparison

A comparison Christ used a few different times in His ministry was that of a mustard seed, comparing the kingdom of heaven and the faith of man to it ([Matthew 13:31-32](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/13.31-32), [Matthew 17:20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/17.20)). Considering that a mustard seed is generally around 1mm in length, and can grow to be as high as 9.144m, this interactive HTML page uses the ratio of 9144:1 to compare your "grown" height to that of large known objects.

Obviously, the comparison was never meant to be literal--this visualization is simply meant to aid indiviudals in understanding the vast scope of potential the Savior referred to in using this example.

### Usage

Download and add your own `.png` images (preferably with transparent backgrounds and exactly. sized) to the `/images/people/` directory. Then update the _ADD YOUR OWN IMAGE NAMES AND SIZES HERE_ section of `mustard-seed-comparison.html` to reference the new files and their cooresponding sizes correctly. They will then be available in the drop-down at the top of the page.
